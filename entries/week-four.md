# Week Four - Testing & OOP

## Summary

This week I paired with Yock and Tarr and focused mainly on TDD and OOP. Both were difficult to wrap my head around but I feel way better after working with the both of them.

### Testing

In the past I have always had a BDD approach to testing. I would write my chunk of code and then write a quick test to make sure it worked. If not I would make some adjustments, test again and then repeat the process until it finally got my end result. This was just the way I always worked on projects and I never gave much thought to it. I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing though. In the end I the result I needed. **BUT...** I have also had a linear approach to programming and this kind of testing worked well for that. As I am trying to transition to OOP I am noticing that my BDD method of testing isn't quite cutting it.

I spent some time reading about what TDD is and thought I had an understanding of it but when I started the Roman Numerals Project (see in the Projects below) I realized I wasn't getting it. I grabbed Yock and thankfully he had me delete my code and start over, this time with a true Test-First approach. It is one thing to read about it but another to actually have someone talk you through it.

I think the TDD approach puts you in a better mindset for OOP. Essentially, before you even start coding you have to think of how you are going to break things down into individual objects figure out how that object needs to work and then you make those objects work together. You can probably program and test OOP with a BDD approach but there is something about BDD that just makes me want to program linearly, probably because that is what I'm used to and old habits die hard.

### OOP

This week I had a eureka moment when I worked with Tarr on Ruby Warriors. I had a mess of if/else statements in the game that I had to go back and make some major edits to and I was lost. We started a new character but this time we attacked it with an OOP approach. Up until that point I was still trying to wrap my head around Object Oriented Programming but actually starting from scratch and re-thinking each level through really helped.

I still have quite a bit of work to do, and need a lot of practice (I caught myself trying to resort to an if statement a few times) but I think I am finally on my way to understanding it better. Checkout my Ruby Warrior repo in the Projects below, I've included both my linear and OOP solutions.
