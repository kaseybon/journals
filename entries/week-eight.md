# Week Eight - JavaScript & The Review

## Summary

### JavaScript

JavaScript is a subject I was dreading. In my past experiences with JS it seemed like I could just look at the code and break it. This was also before I had any programming experience at all and didn't realize what JS was for and how much it could do. I thought it was just a way to handle mouse events on a website.

It was a tiny bit difficult to get started after spending most of my time in Ruby. The differences in the syntax threw me off a few times and I found myself trying to blend Ruby and JS which didn't work very well. It wasn't to difficult to get on the right track though since JS is styled very similarly to PHP which is what I worked with in the past.

I really had no interest in learning JavaScript at the beginning of the internship but now I rather like it and am excited to keep learning.

### Review

This review had me nervous! In the couple of months that I've been here I have learned so much but once I was told I had to present what I had learned suddenly it felt like I forgot everything. After I snapped out of that funk I chose to talk about an epiphany moment I had when learning OOP and talked about my Ruby Warriors project.
