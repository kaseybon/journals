## Summary

Stupid spring and the allergies that come with it... Or it was a cold and I infected the office. If I did, I apologize.

### Game of Life

This week we started the Game of Life project. I think I sat for about an hour just looking at my computer screen trying to figure out where to start. Finally I figured it would be ok to see how other people got started. I found a video a developer who was going to work through the kata and after watching for a few minutes I had an idea of where to start. In the video he started with a Cell class and I initially tried to start there but quickly changed my mind and created a Neighbor class instead (check out my progress below). Could this be considered cheating? Possibly, but I needed a starting point and I took a different path than the other developer so I don't feel too guilty.

Once I finally got started though I came up with a game plan to build independent classes that will generate the information that I need. Then once those are all built I will put them together into one awesome class/function that will calculate the next generation of my grid. So far this is working for me but we'll see next week if this really was the way to do it when I'm ready to put everything together.
