#Week One

##Summary

In applying for the apprenticeship I knew I wanted to learn more about backend development but hadn't really thought about specific goals I would like to accomplish. After being asked for specific goals and worries I gave it some thought and came up with these:

###Goals

1. Of course learning more about backend development is at the top of the list but I should clarify specifically what I want to learn. Eventually I would like to know enough of a server side language to build a custom backend for a website. In the past I have relied on WordPress for a CMS but it can be bloated and customizations can be overly complicated.
1. I want to write better code the first time. When looking back at previous websites I've built sometimes I cringe at how things could have been cleaner and better organized.
1. Coming from a smaller town made it difficult to be part of a development community since there wasn't a community to be part of. I would actually like to participate in meetups and get to know other developers and talk geeky.

###Worries

1. Self doubt is a big worry of mine. I only have a two year degree which didn't come with a top notch education and I really didn't start to learn how to code until a few years ago so it can be intimidating to try and work alongside developers who have been coding for much longer.
1. Sparkbox has a lot of people working there and large groups can be tough for me. I tend to be a bit shy and awkward until I get to know people.
1. Another worry of mine is making sure I KEEP a balance between my home life and the web. There was a period of time where tinkering with things on the internet consumed most of my time. I would come home from work and then spend a good portion of the evening in front of the computer and this made things difficult on my family. That absolutely cannot and will not happen again.


##Things Learned

1. I have always wanted to learn Git but none of my previous team mates ever wanted to learn with me and version control just doesn't seem like much fun when you're the only one doing it. In the first four days I learned more about Git and the command line than I thought I could in such a short time. I look forward to learning more about them both.
1. If you have two step authorization enabled on your Github account you can't use your account password, that would be too simple. You need to create an Personal Access Token and use that in place of the password.
1. I learned that a place like Sparkbox existed, it's pretty sweet!
1. Lastly I learned the best method to trim the gross, bottom bit from asparagus: Don't cut it, snap it!
