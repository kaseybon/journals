# Weeks Five, Six & Seven - Girl Scouts, Ruby, & Build Responsively

## Summary

I've gotten a little behind on my journals so I'm going to lump weeks five, six and seven together.

### Girl Scouts

A large portion of my time these weeks was preparing for the Girl Scouts workshop which was well worth the extra effort! I have wanted to work with kids and teach web design/development for quite some time but never knew how to get started. This was such a fun experience and I really hope to do more workshops like it in the future.

It was also nice to get to build a website again. Since leaving my job in Findlay I haven't gotten to play around with HTML and CSS at all and I've really missed it!

### Ruby

In these three weeks I finished the Triangles and Fizz Buzz katas (although I need to rework my Fizz Buzz a bit) and started on the Bowling kata. Eventually I have my own Kata I would like to build involving Sourdough...

### Build Responsively

For two mornings in week seven we got to sit with Ben for Build Responsively. I've built responsive websites for the past two years so much of it was a refresher for me but it was still really informative and I have a browser full of tabs I'm to read through. The method of creating intrinsic ratios for responsive, embedded video was particularly interesting as I could have used that info quite a few times in the past.
