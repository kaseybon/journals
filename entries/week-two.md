#Week Two - Ruby Basics

##Summary

Week two was exciting for me because one of the things I really want to learn is Ruby. In the past I have tried to learn but I never needed to use it so I forgot most of it by the next day. I was also on my own trying to learn it and didn't have anyone to answer my questions or to just talk about it with.

Jumping into the Koans was super frustrating and discouraging at first because I felt lost and like I wasn't learning anything. After just working through it and meditating on it (har har) I realized that I had actually learned more about the language than I had in all of my previous attempts. Sure I was probably remembering bits and pieces of what I had previously learned but this time it feels like it is starting to stick.

One thing that really helped my was taking a break from the Koans after I felt bored with them and then jumping into the Ruby Bits on Codeschool. It was a nice break from the Koans and a chance to use some of the new stuff I learned. It was also a morale booster because that is when I realized I was actually learning from the Koans.
