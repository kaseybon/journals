# Journals

Documenting my time at [Sparkbox](http://seesparkbox.com) and sharing my notes with the world.

## What this is
This repo will be split into three sections, entries, notes and book reports. The entries will be the actual journal entires that cover each week during my apprenticeship. The notes section will be broken down into the awesome subjects I learn about. Lastly, Sparkbox encourages us to read so I will write about what I learned.
