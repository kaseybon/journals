# Journals

Documenting my time at [Sparkbox](http://seesparkbox.com) and sharing my notes with the world.

## What this is
This repo will be split into two sections, entries and notes. The entries will be the actual journal entires that cover each week during my apprenticeship. The notes section will be broken down into the awesome subjects I learn about.
