#Getting Real

Getting Real is all about how to focus on building better software by both cutting the fluff out of the process and simplifying the product. The trick to building a quality product, or service even, is to stay small and gradually improve and add features... but only if they are absolutely necessary.

One of the most helpful things that stood out to me was the concept of ignoring the details early on. This is something I used to get hung up on in the past. Once you start to focus on the tiny details they start to become overwhelming and you begin to lose sight of the overall project. Stepping back and abstracting the project from the beginning will allow you to create a solid structure that you can build upon, gradually add in the details.

One thing that I donâ€™t think the book addresses is why it is so common to want to go big right away. Personally I think it is human nature to be excited for the finished product that you jump into planning the finished part. The excitement isn't a bad thing and neither is having a vision for the finished product we just need to slow down and focus on quality.

Another book that I would recommend that kind of goes along with this is [Laws of Simplicity](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262134721/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0262134721&linkCode=as2&tag=redesiglead03-20&linkId=VCENF5MJ3OEBGHBL) by John Maeda.

**On a side note:** I was actually aware of the authors of the book, 37signals, before reading the book. I had used their service Basecamp at a previous job and while we loved the simplicity and ease of use of the service it was almost too simple to be useful for our company and we out grew it.

I find it interesting that 37signals eventually discontinued updates to their other services and focus solely on Basecamp, even going so far to change the company name from 37signals to Basecamp. The goal was to focus all of their resources on making one service great versus making multiple services that were just good.
