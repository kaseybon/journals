# Testing

## Terminology

**Test-First Development** - (TFD) Writing a failing test first, before even writing code, and then after the test fails go back and change the code to eventually get a passing test. Then go back, write another test and repeat the process.

**Test-Driven Development** - (TDD) Essentially Test-First Development but includes going back and refactoring code after a test has passed.

**Developer TDD** - (Often referred to simply as TDD)

**Acceptance TDD** - (ATDD also called Behavior-Driven Development or BDD)

## Questions

1. In what I have read RSpec is referred to as a BDD system while MiniTest is a TDD but couldn't you use either approach with each framework?
