## Definitions

**Discrete Mathematics** - Mathematics that deals with discrete objects (those which are separate from/distinct from each other).

**Probability Theory** - The branch of mathematics that is concerned with probability. Studies seemingly random data (for example: rolling dice) and finds patterns to predict future values.

**Equiprobability** - Concept that states that results that have an equal value are equally probable. Example, when rolling a die there are 6 outcomes that are equally likely.

**Event** - An arbitrary set of pre-established outcomes.
